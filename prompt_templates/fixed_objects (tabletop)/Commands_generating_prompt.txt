I want to collect examples of instructions that a person might give to a robot. You need to generate {} sets of instructions using the [object list] provided. Each set should include <USED_OBJECTS>, which represent the objects used in the instruction, and <INSTRUCTION>, which is a brief sentence describing the task. Please adhere to the guidelines mentioned in [Condition of the instructions generated] below.

To help you structure your responses, I've given you an [Output template] to follow. You should replace the placeholders <USED_OBJECTS> and <INSTRUCTION> with appropriate content, using the [Example of output] as a reference. Please ensure that the formatting and template I provide are maintained.

----------------------------------
[Condition of the instructions generated]
* The instructions generated must be one that can be performed by picking up and placing the objects.
* You should generate instructions using three or more objects in the [Object list] below.
* Generate instructions in the following order :
Step 1. Select three or more objects to use from the [Object list]
Step 2. Generate an instruction using only the selected objects in step 1.

[Output example]
(Red square block,  Blue square block,  Yellow square block,  Green square block, Yellow bowl), Arrange all square blocks in rainbow order.

[Output template]

[Note]
